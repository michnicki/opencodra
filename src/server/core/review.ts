// estimate => more units reviewed in parallel per chunk within the same 50-subrequest cap.

// This is a per-(file,pass)-UNIT cost that governs CONCURRENCY (how many units run in one chunk),

/**
 * The dedicated critic phase (D-07 / D-05 / MP-03). Runs BETWEEN review and finalize on its OWN fresh
 * subrequest budget: it assembles the full candidate finding set (union of every (file, pass) review
 * row), dedupes it (only when the security pass is on — Pitfall 4), then makes at most ONE whole-set,
 * ID-based, PRUNE-ONLY model call and reconciles `kept = deduped MINUS pruned-by-index` in code (a
 * model keep-list is never trusted — T-10-10). The result blob { kept, pruned } is persisted to
 * jobs.critic_result for finalize (10-07) to consume.
 *
 * Two hard contracts:
 *   - IDEMPOTENT: a valid persisted job.criticResult short-circuits straight to finalize with NO model
 *     call, so a re-invocation after a persist-then-enqueue-failure never re-critiques (review-verified
 *     HIGH).
 *   - FAIL-OPEN (D-05): the critic is conservative and NEVER terminal-fails or loses a finding. On any
 *     model/parse error (including RetryableModelError) it keeps ALL findings and records
 *     { skipped: true, pruned: [] }; only a subrequest-budget error is re-thrown so it retries on a
 *     fresh instance (continueOrFailWedgedJob's critic ceiling), then fails open to finalize.
 * The critic model call NEVER runs inside finalize (D-07) — it lives only here.
