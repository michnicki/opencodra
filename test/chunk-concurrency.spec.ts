// assertions encode that budget model NON-tautologically: rather than re-asserting the already-proven
// budgetAwareFileLimit(fresh, max) === max identity (the four tests above), they relate the per-unit
// estimate, the fresh-budget headroom, and the max concurrency level so the trio fails the moment the
// per-unit cost (or SAFE_MARGIN) is pushed into a slider-defeating range.
//
// NOTE ON INTRA-UNIT FAN-OUT: a single (file,pass) unit may still fan out to MAX_CHUNKS (=4) chunks
// inside ModelService.reviewFile (model.ts:320-337), bounded WITHIN the unit by tracker.isNearLimit().
// That intra-unit chunking is a SEPARATE bound; ESTIMATED_SUBREQUESTS_PER_FILE governs how many UNITS
// run concurrently per chunk. The workload-level proof that a doubled unit list (including a large
// multi-chunk security file) never exceeds budgetAwareFileLimit concurrent calls lives in
// review-flow.spec.ts (behavioral concurrency test).
